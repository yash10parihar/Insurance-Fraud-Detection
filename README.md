# Insurance-Fraud-Detection
Predictive modeling project to detect fraudulent first-party auto insurance claims using structured claim data. Built using Python, the model was developed for the 2023 NESS Statathon and achieved optimized fraud detection performance through oversampling and interpretability techniques like permutation importance and PDP.
